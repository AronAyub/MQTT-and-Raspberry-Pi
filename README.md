# Creating Solutions Using MQTT and Raspberry Pi

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol which is a publish-subscribe messaging that allows devices and applications to communicate with each other over a network.

In MQTT, messages are published to a "broker" which then distributes them to "subscribers" who have expressed interest in receiving messages on a particular topic. Topics are hierarchical and can be used to organize messages into a logical structure.

MQTT is often used in the Internet of Things (IoT) to connect sensors, devices, and applications. It is designed to be efficient, with a small protocol overhead and low network bandwidth usage, making it well-suited for use in resource-constrained environments. MQTT also supports a range of Quality of Service (QoS) levels, allowing publishers to control the delivery of messages to subscribers.

Overall, MQTT is a simple, efficient, and flexible messaging protocol that is widely used in IoT applications to enable communication between devices and applications.
